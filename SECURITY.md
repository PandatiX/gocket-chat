# Reporting Security Issues

Please report any security issues you discovered in the API to lucas.tesson@protonmail.com.

We will assess the risk, plus make a fix available before we create a GitHub issue.

In case the vulnerability is into RocketChat, do not report this to us but follow [RocketChat's SECURITY.md](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/develop/SECURITY.md).

Thank you for your contribution.
